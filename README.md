## Redesigned outdated website - FJU alumi systen webpage

The outdated webpage is not user-friendly. When you want to find information in this webpage, you always have to link to other tab to find out the link. Therefore, I decide to redesign the UI for this system.


### Outlook

1. This is the index page I made.
<p align="center">
   <img src="oc-image/1.png" width="75%" height="75%">
</p>

2. In Hiring page, you can see there some companies icon you can edit. Also, there are some links you can link to.
<p align="center">
   <img src="oc-image/2.png" width="75%" height="75%">
</p>

3. There are still some pages need to redesigned. So I redesigned this page like this.
<p align="center">
   <img src="oc-image/3.png" width="75%" height="75%">
</p>
